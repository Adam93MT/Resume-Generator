<p>Hello Roli Team,</p>

<p>I am a UX and Product Designer from the University of Waterloo, with a huge passion for music and audio. I've been singing and playing guitar since before high-school, and have been designing apps since 2013.</p>

<p>At Noom—a health and wellness startup in New York—I worked on the UX and product design team where my main project was to re-design the meal-logging experience in the app, which was a challenging navigation problem. The UI patterns used had to be carefully thought out so each entry case would be intuitive.</p>

<p>More recently I worked as a Product Manager for Zynga Poker. Though I worked on feature design for a more mature game, I was exposed to many principles of game design, like the design of a good core loop, meta-game, and balance of the two.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked as the premiere UX Designer at KnowRoaming in Toronto where I worked on re-designing their account management app from the ground-up—everything from the core workflow to the UI.</p>

<p>I've been making music for many years, both on my own and in groups. In University, I performed at many open mic. nights, and was a soloist in the ICCA Semifinalist group, The Water Boys. For my own music, and for production as a staff filmmaker, I have recorded and mixed using Logic, and ProTools.</p>

<p>I am currently finishing up my final-year engineering design project at the University of Waterloo, where we are designing and building a hearing protection device for use by stagehands and industrial workers to vary attenuation based on the volume of the environment.</p>

<p>With over 3 years of experience in design, and a passion for music, I feel I have the required skills, experience, and drive to be a successful UX designer Roli. For more, please visit my portfolio online at adamthompson.ca. I will be visiting London in late April/early May if you'd like to meet in person.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
