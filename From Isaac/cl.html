		<h2>DEAR HIRING MANAGER,</h2><br />
		<p>
			I am very interested in the position you have advertised in Jobmine. I am a student in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo in the co-op program. I would appreciate your consideration for the job. My related experience and excellent capabilities make me a great candidate.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			The position you have posted excites me because it sits at an intersection between client relations and technological systems. I am a very personable person and highly value being a team player but I also enjoy learning how to apply design methodologies to a wide range of disciplines. In my courses in Systems Design Engineering, I have learned how to analyze a problem based on various inputs and innovate solutions. One example of this was when myself and four other students were able to design a solution for skiers who had physical disabilities that prevented them from being able to ski alone. My design team was able to meet with different disabled skiers and also ski instructors and define the situation of concern. From that, we were able to come up with an innovative solution to the design problem. This project was especially rewarding for me because not only was I able to apply innovative problem solving, but I was also able to interact with the users who are being directly effected by my design.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			I am also the kind of person who likes to be the worst player on the field (or ice, or court). This is because I know that being challenged is the best way to learn something or grow in your abilities. Projects that scare me also excite me because I know that I will be a different person when it is finished. One example of this was my time as the Project Manager and also developer of the CGIS application SLIMS 3.0. After working at CGIS for less than a week, I was given the project requirements and had to start designing this brand new web application. This scared me because I had never designed a web application before and had no idea how to even approach these design requirements. But those next few weeks of asking lots of questions, learning how to communicate with the team, and working extra hours to learn the technology were so enjoyable that this is still one of my favourite projects I have ever contributed to. The position you have posted is a challenging role and I am excited about the opportunity to learn and grow with TD Securities.

			Thank you for taking the time to review my experience and credentials. My resume is enclosed for your review. Thank you again for your consideration. 
		</p>
		<br />
		<br />

		Sincerely, <br /><br />
		Isaac Hunter<br />
