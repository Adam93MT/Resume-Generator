Senior Product Designers at Huge are responsible for designing elegant, simple, hard-working interfaces that will be used by millions of people every day.  They work closely with Interaction Designers, Visual Designers, and Developers to concept, design, prototype, test, and iterate products until they meet our high standards of quality. A successful Product Designer has an eagerness to jump in and solve problems and a unique combination of proven talent and ability in interface design, visual design and basic coding. Product designers are often asked to quickly come up with game changing ideas and make them come to life for our clients.

Senior Product Designers communicate conceptual ideas and detailed design rationale both verbally and visually in a way that is both effective and captivating. They have a high level of autonomy and they manage the product design process, drive decisions, track issues, and assist in estimating resource needs and schedules. They also help to mentor and grow other interaction and visual designers on project teams.
