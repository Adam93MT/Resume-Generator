Hi Weebly Team,

I am a passionate product designer wanting to build meaningful products that make an impact. I had a good conversation with Lanae recently at the P4E career fair in Waterloo, who directed me to your career website.

I have been designing since 2013, with roles at companies like Sony, Noom, KnowRoaming and Zynga. I recently graduated Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo with a cognitive science minor, where I designed and built [Chameleon](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=chameleon), a hearing protection device that solves real needs of workers.

Particularly in my time at [KnowRoaming](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=knowroaming), where I was an independent designer, I saw the app re-design project from the earliest kernel of an idea through to implementation. Throughout the process, I worked closely with engineers and PMs to breathe life the designs, and initiated semi-weekly meetings to communicate the logic behind the ideas, and to solicit, and distill design feedback and critique. I did the same daily at Noom, and again weekly with Zynga, presenting research findings and design rationale to interdisciplinary teams. 

With [Noom](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=noom), I conducted user research, task analysis, and usability testing. The findings from these tests were used to inform further information architecture and interaction design iterations, and to adjust the conceptual model to match the common mental model if needed. This can be seen in the simplification of the Noom food logging interface, and the contextual design changes in the KnowRoaiming app.

In addition to mockups and prototypes, common deliverables I've produced in various projects include personas, storyboards, use stories, and flowcharts. User stories and flowcharts were used extensively in my work at Noom.

I really believe I have the skills and passion for great design that will make me an excellent designer with Weebly, and I look forward to chatting with someone from the team soon. Please check out my portfolio online at [adamthompson.ca](http://adamthompson.ca) for more.
