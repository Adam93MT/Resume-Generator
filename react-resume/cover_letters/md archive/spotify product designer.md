Hi Spotify Team,


I'm a product designer, passionate about creating products, especially when it comes to music. You can often find me writing, singing or playing my guitar at home or at an open mic. This past spring I had the amazing opportunity to perform at the Beacon theatre in the finals of the [International Competition for Collegiate A Capella](https://varsityvocals.com/event/the-2017-international-championship-of-collegiate-a-cappella-finals-the-beacon-theatre/) with the Water Boys.

My passion for music, and enabling people to enjoy the experience of listening led me to create my most recent project with a team of peersâ€”a [hearing protection device](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=chameleon) that solves users' real needs, and responds to the environment. 

We interviewed potential users to figure out what their current behaviours were, and found that workers often don't wear hearing protection because it's inconvenient and uncomfortable. So we got to work on developing a device that could be worn the whole day, and that allowed you to speak without removing it. Our prototype was a big success, and won us two major awards. 

I tell this story to demonstrate how we let users lead the way in developing the product. Without listening to users, and letting their needs guide us to the best solutions, we could not have made an award-winning project. 

I've also worked as a product designer at companies like Sony, KnowRoaming and Noom where I worked closely with engineering, PMs, operations and marketing to find elegant and practical solutions to design challenges.

At [KnowRoaming](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=knowroaming), I was in charge of re-designing the mobile app in order to make it clearer and more consistent. I set the vision for the holistic user experience and initiated semiweekly meetings to communicate design rationale, and brainstorm new concepts.

Almost constantly in my work there, and at [Noom](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=noom), I was sketching concepts, tweaking flows and polishing designs. At Noom while simplifying the core food-logging interface, I developed and tested dozens of different flows and prototypes before arriving at the one that tested best.

I do really think I have the passion and skill it'll take to be a great product designer with Spotify, and I look forward to chatting with someone from the team soon. Please check out my portfolio online at [adamthompson.ca](http://adamthompson.ca) for more.
