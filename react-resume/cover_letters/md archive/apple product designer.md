Hello Apple Design Team,

I'm a product designer, with a passion for great design, and solving meaningful problems. I've designed interfaces, user flows and prototypes with companies like Sony, Noom, Zynga and KnowRoaming, each time solving unique design challenges in fast-paced environments.

My most recent project was Chameleon—a [hearing protection device](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=chameleon) that solves users' real needs, and responds to your environment.  

For this project interviewed potential users to figure out their current behaviours, and got to work on developing a device that solved those problems. Our prototype was a big success, and won us two major awards—something we couldn't have done so well without first knowing our users.

In my professional product design experience, I worked closely with engineering, PMs, operations and marketing to find elegant and practical solutions to design challenges.

While simplifying a core experience at [Noom](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=noom), I conducted user requirements research, task analysis, and usability testing. I used these findings to iterate on different new visuals, interactions and prototypes, and to adjust the conceptual model to match the common mental model if needed. 

At [KnowRoaming](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=knowroaming), I was and independent designer, and was in charge of re-designing the mobile app in order to make it clearer and more consistent. I set up semiweekly meetings to discuss design concepts and rationale with  different arms of the company. I did the same on a daily basis at Noom, and again weekly at Zynga, presenting research findings and design rationale to interdisciplinary teams can collaborating on design solutions.

Common tools I use to create visuals, after pen and paper, include Balsamiq and Sketch on macOS, and I have proficiency in Photoshop, Illustrator and other AdobeCC apps as well. I use tools like InVision, Framer, Origami, and good old HTML/CSS to make prototypes, and build apps with JavaScript, Python, and Swift.

I do really think I have the passion and skill it'll take to be a great product designer with Apple, and I look forward to chatting with someone from the team soon. Please check out my portfolio online at [adamthompson.ca](http://adamthompson.ca) for more.
