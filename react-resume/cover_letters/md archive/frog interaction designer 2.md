Hello Frog Design Team,

I'm a product designer hoping to create meaningful products that make an impact. Though I don't limit myself to "product designer", I feel like this title communicates how I bring holistic, user-centered design processes and methodologies to website, application, and device design.

I have been designing in both professional and academic settings since 2013, with roles at companies like Sony, Noom, KnowRoaming and Zynga, and graduated Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo with a cognitive science minor, where I designed and built Chameleon, a hearing protection device that solves real needs of workers. 

Specifically in my time with Noom and KnowRoaming, but also in other work, I conducted user requirements research, task analysis, and usability testing. The findings from these tests were used to inform further information architecture and interaction design iterations, and to adjust the conceptual model to match the common mental model if needed. This can be seen in the simplification of the Noom food logging interface, and the contextual design changes in the KnowRoaiming app.

In addition to mockups and prototypes, common deliverables I've produced in various projects include personas, storyboards, use stories, and flowcharts. User stories and flowcharts were used extensively in my work at Noom.

At KnowRoaming, I was the only designer, and had to effectively communicate design concepts and rationale at semiweekly meetings to non-designers. I did the same on a daily basis at Noom, and again weekly at Zynga, presenting research findings and design rationale to interdisciplinary teams. 

Common tools I use to create visuals, after pen and paper, include Balsamiq and Sketch, and I have proficiency in Photoshop, Illustrator and other AdobeCC apps as well. I use tools like InVision, Framer, Origami, and good old HTML/CSS to make prototypes, and build apps with JavaScript, and Python.

With four years of design experience, an engineering education, and a passion for creating great products that resonate with people, I feel I have what it takes to be a successful interaction designer with Frog.
