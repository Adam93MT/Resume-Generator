Hi Lyft Team,

I'm a product designer always looking to push boundaries and design products that make a big impact. I have both an eye for detail in design, making sure each pixel is perfect, as well as a mind for the big-picture, for innovation and new ideas. 

I have been designing for mobile, web, and desktop since 2013, with roles at companies like Sony, Noom, KnowRoaming and Zynga. In all these roles I worked closely with other designers, engineers, PMs, and more to find delightful and practical solutions to design challenges that locked-in on user needs.

I graduated with a degree in Systems Design Engineering, a holistic engineering field, with a focus in cognitive science and user-centered design. In my final year I applied all I'd learned with [Chameleon](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=chameleon), an adaptive hearing protection device that solves real needs expressed by real workers.

While simplifying a core experience in the iOS and Android apps at [Noom](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=noom), I used the findings from rigorous user testing findings to iterate on new wireframes visuals, interactions and prototypes using Sketch, Framer, Origami, InVision and Marvel. This was a highly iterative process, resulting in at least a dozen prototypes before arriving at the final solution, and delivering mocks and assets via Zeplin.

At [KnowRoaming](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=knowroaming), I was in charge of re-designing the mobile app in order to make it clearer and more consistent. I set the vision for the holistic user experience and initiated semiweekly meetings to communicate design rationale to stakeholders, and brainstorm new concepts.

I do believe I have the skills and passion for design it will take to be a great designer with Lyft, and I hope to speak with someone from the team soon!
