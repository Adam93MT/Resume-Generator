Hi Curalate Team,

I'm a recent grad of Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo—a multidisciplinary engineering program with an emphasis on holistic design thinking. I have worked as a designer for companies like Noom in New York, KnowRoaming in Toronto, and Sony, and as a product manager for Zynga. 

In my most recent UX role at <a href="http://www.noom.com">Noom</a>—a health and lifestyle startup in New York—I worked on the product design team where my main project involved re-designing the meal-logging experience in the app. The UI patterns and flow used here had to be carefully thought out so each entry case would be intuitive. I created many mockups and prototypes using Invision, Marvel and Framer, and shared final Sketch files with developers using Zeplin.

Previously, I worked as the premiere UX Designer at <a href="http://www.knowroaming.com">KnowRoaming</a> in Toronto where I worked on re-designing their app from the ground-up. Everything from the core workflow, to the UI, icons and branding was reworked in my 8 months with the company.

With several years of experience in design already, and a love for music, I feel I have the required skills, experience, and passion to be a successful product designer with Curalate. For more, please visit my portfolio online at adamthompson.ca.
