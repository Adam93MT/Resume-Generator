Hi Squarespace Team,

I spoke with a rep recently at the P4E career fair in Waterloo, who directed me to your career website, since she wasn't directly hiring for this position. I am a passionate product designer and front-end developer, wanting to build meaningful products that make an impact.

While most of my professional experience is in product design and UX, I am no stranger to development. As a graduate of Systems Design Engineering, I have built numerous project in various languages. 

At Noom, I built a number of prototypes in CoffeeScript using Framer.js, as well as some small app components in Swift. As the lone-designer at KnowRoaming, I designed and built a [sign-up form](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=kr_athletes) for athlete sponsors, and re-styled the mobile web page to match the native app design. I have done similar types of development work as well with Sony and Zynga.

Outside of work, I have written several web apps, from the trivial [Colour Thermometer](http://adamthompson.ca/ColourThermometer), which represents the current weather conditions as an HSV colour, to [SMRTWATR](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=smrtwatr), a quiz game built in JavaScript with a Tornado Python server. I also built my  portfolio website from scratch: [adamthompson.ca](http://adamthompson.ca).

I am also currently working with React and React Native, having recently built a resume-builder in React (yeah, maybe I'm crazy), and refactoring my TAP metronome app into React Native. Check out these projects and more on [GitHub](https://github.com/Adam93MT).

The majority of my work though has focused on user experience design, making sure the product suits the requirements of the user by researching users' behaviour and testing apps rigorously. 

In all, I'm a multitalented designer and developer, and I'm confident I have what it takes to be a successful creative developer with Squarespace. I look forward to speaking with someone from the team soon!
