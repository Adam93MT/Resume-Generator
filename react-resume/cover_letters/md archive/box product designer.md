Hi Box Design Team,

I'm a product designer, or full-stack designer, or whatever you want to call meâ€”I'm passionate for making great products that look amazing and work great.

User-centered design is at the center of all my work. While simplifying a core experience in the iOS and Android apps at [Noom](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=noom), I used the findings from rigorous user testing findings to iterate on new wireframes visuals, interactions and prototypes using Sketch, Framer, Origami, InVision and Marvel. This was a highly iterative process, resulting in at least a dozen prototypes before arriving at the final solution, and delivering mocks and assets via Zeplin.

At [KnowRoaming](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=knowroaming), I was in charge of re-designing the mobile app in order to make it clearer and more consistent. I set the vision for the holistic user experience and initiated semiweekly meetings to communicate design rationale to stakeholders, and brainstorm new concepts.

I do believe I have the skills and passion for design it will take to be a great designer with Box, and I hope to speak with someone from the team soon!
