Hi Squarespace Team,

I am a product designer at heart, building meaningful products for real people, and make an impact. I recently attended the P4E career fair in Waterloo, and spoke with a rep who directed me to your career website, since she wasn't directly hiring for this position. 

I have been designing since 2013, with roles at companies like Sony, Noom, KnowRoaming and Zynga. I recently graduated Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo with a cognitive science minor, where I designed and built [Chameleon](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=chameleon), a hearing protection device that solves real needs of workers.

While simplifying a core experience at [Noom](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=noom), I conducted user research and testing, ensuring usability and product consistency. I used these findings to iterate on different visuals, interactions, wireframes and prototypes, and to develop rational, articulable, elegant solutions to complex problems. After designing and prototyping in Sketch, InVision and Framer, I delivered the polished comps, assets and flows to developers via Zeplin.

At [KnowRoaming](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=knowroaming), I was and independent designer, and was in charge of re-designing the mobile app in order to make it clearer and more consistent. I set up semiweekly meetings to discuss design concepts and rationale with  different arms of the company. I did the same on a daily basis at Noom, and again weekly at Zynga, presenting research findings and design rationale to interdisciplinary teams can collaborating on project specifications and scoping.

I really believe I have the skills and passion for great design that will make me an excellent designer with Squarespace, and I look forward to chatting with someone from the team soon! Please check out my portfolio online at [adamthompson.ca](http://adamthompson.ca) for more.
