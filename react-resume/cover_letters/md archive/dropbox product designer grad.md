Hi Dropbox Team,

I'm a passionate product designer with internship experience at companies like Zynga, Sony, Noom and KnowRoaming, and recently graduated from Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. In my final year there, I researched the needs of industrial workers, and developed a hearing protection product to allow them to do their job more effectively.

User-centered design is at the center of all my work. While simplifying a core experience at [Noom](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=noom), I conducted user requirements research, task analysis, and usability testing. I used the findings from these processes to iterate on different visuals, interactions and prototypes, using Sketch, Framer, Origami, Marvel and InVision before arriving at a design that fit the needs of our users.

This was an interesting project, and required thinking through numerous different edge cases. Similarly, at [KnowRoaming](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=knowroaming) I was an independent designer, and was in charge of re-designing the mobile app to make it clearer and more consistent. I thought through how a user might use the app, and designed for all use cases and scenarios. 

At KnowRoaming, I set up and ran semiweekly design meetings to collaborate with our engineering, marketing, and product management, and to present my designs and their rationale. I did the same at Noom and Zynga, meeting regularly to discuss, critique and collaborate on design problems and potential solutions.

In addition to product design, I've worked in print graphic design, web development and UI interactions, particularly at KnowRoaming, where I wore a lot of different hats.

I believe I have what it takes to be a great product designer at Dropbox, and would make a great addition to the team. I hope to speak with someone from the team soon!
