My proudest project has to be Chameleon Hearing Protectionâ€”a hearing protection device that responds to the volume of the environment. For my capstone engineering project, we did market analysis and prior art search to find a space we were interested in, and where we could solve a real problem. We interviewed stakeholders and potential users to figure out what their current behaviours were, and figure out what problems needed to be solved. Once we had established personas and user requirements, we figured out what these meant for technological requirements, and got to work designing mechanical, software and electrical systems. After several small prototypes, and two full system prototypes, we ended up with a working device that solved nearly all of our user requirements. With our prototype and marketing pitch, we won both People's Choice at our class symposium, and the Norman Esch Entrepreneurship award. 

I had a friend who interned at Palantir in New York a few years ago and had the chance to visit the office and chat about the kind of work the company does. The variety of work and industries that Palantir is involved in is something that really intrigues me, as a multidisciplinary designer/engineer.
