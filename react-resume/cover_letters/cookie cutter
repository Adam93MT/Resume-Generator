Hi [] team!
I'm a product designer and grad from Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo. I've designed at companies like Zynga, Sony, Noom and KnowRoaming, and have worked on many aspects of products, for improving usability and app architecture based on user research and testing results, to analyzing user trends and finessing feature parameters to optimize the user experience.  I meet or exceed all the requirements for this position, and believe I would be a great asset to []. I hope to be able to chat with someone from the team soon!
