clContent = 'Hi Shutterstock Team,\n\nI\'m a passionate product designer, no stranger to user research, and bringing a thoughtful, holistic approach to user experience and beautiful execution on interfaces.\n\nI\'ve been designing professionally since 2013, with experience at companies like Sony, Noom, Zynga and KnowRoaming, and a degree in Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo.\n\nIn all my experience, collaboration with developers, PMs, designers and other stakeholders has been a key to product success. At [KnowRoaming](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=knowroaming), I pioneered semiweekly design meetings with numerous stakeholders to discuss ideas and present design rationale. At Noom and Zynga, I participated in regular meetings to discuss product strategy and inform design decisions.\n\nWhile simplifying a core experience at [Noom](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=noom), I conducted user requirements research, task analysis, and usability testing, and used the findings to iterate on new visuals, interactions and prototypes. We had at least a dozen iterations before finding a solution that worked just right.\n\nI was the first designer at KnowRoaming, and was in charge of re-designing the mobile app in order to make it clearer and more consistent. I set the vision for the overall user experience and UI, while also working on a number of other projects.\n\nFinally, in my experience at [Zynga](http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=zynga), I dove deep into data, analyzing player trends and payer demographics in order to properly spec a new subscription feature. I used Zynga\'s vast amounts of data to estimate project outcomes and make educated design decisions.\n\nI believe I have the passion and skill to be a great designer with Shutterstock, and hope to chat with someone from the team soon!\n\nPlease check out my portfolio online at [adamthompson.ca](http://adamthompson.ca) for more.\n\n'
