In one paragraph, what do you hope to accomplish as a Code for Canada fellow?

I hope to build something meaningful for Canada in the year of its 150th. To be part of the development of a product that can enhance the lives of others is one of my primary goals in looking for work. Given the opportunity, I would be excited to design for a government team and make an impact in improving civic technology. I hope to improve and refine my skills in user experience design, while at the same time exploring new industries and developing new skills.

In one paragraph, tell us about a project you're proud to have been part of.

I am proud to have been a part of designing and building the fully-functional interactive water fountain SMRTWATR with 5 other classmates in Systems Design Engineering. Our team consisted of multitalented individuals each with our own specialization. While my primary role was as the app designer and front-end web developer, I still played a large role in the development of the back-end server, as well as the mechanical and electrical components. Likewise, other team members who focused mainly on other components contributed to the development and design of the game. It was extremely rewarding to be part of this diverse and collaborative team working on a large-scale project. 

In one paragraph, tell us about an experience you've had with a government service or program that could have been improved. What was it? How could it work better?

A number of years ago I earned my Ontario G-level drivers' licence after passing the G2 exit test. Not long after I received the card in the mail, I received a notice informing me that my licence would expire shortly. This lead to some frustration since I would have to return to the licence office to get a new licence and photo only some months after getting an old one. While it is my understanding that most of this renewal process is now possible to do online, the problem of requiring renewal shortly after earning a licence remains. Without knowing the inner-workings of the department, a solution to this would be to unpdate the licence expiration date at the time the new licence is earned. This effectivly would combine the processes of earning and receiving a new licence, and licence renewal.
