Hello Lyft team,

I'm a designer with an engineering degree from the University of Waterloo, and I'm passionate about how products are made, and interacted with. As a holistic-thinking systems design engineer, I try to solve on the root problem, involve and collaborate with all stakeholders, and lead the design process with intention, and a drive to push the boundaries.

I have previously worked at Zynga as a product manager, where I was involved in all aspects in the design process for different initiatives; from sketching early UX wireframes and workflows, to managing and analyzing the success of different multivariate tests based on relevant KPIs, and using these insights to drive further design decisions.

At Noom, a health and lifestyle startup in New York, as well as at KnowRoaming, a telecom startup in Toronto, I leveraged user feedback from various tests and interviews to draw insights and improve the experience of the apps. In the case of Noom, my improvements to the core meal-logging workflow have significantly reduced the error rates in entering meals.

I was also responsible at Sony, and as the sole designer at KnowRoaming, for designing and developing web forms and HTML emails for marketing outreach, and measuring the CTR of these messages.

I hope I've shown here that I have the relevant experience and skills to be a great designer at Lyft. Hope to chat with someone from the team soon.
