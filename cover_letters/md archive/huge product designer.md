Hello Huge team,

I'm a designer with an engineering degree from the University of Waterloo, and I'm passionate about how products are made, and interacted with. As a holistic-thinking systems design engineer, I have a strong ability to understand customer needs, and translate them into actionable deliverables. This often involves a good amoun of user research, and collaborating with all stakeholders throughout the design process.

In my most recent UX role at [Noom](http://www.noom.com)—a health and lifestyle startup in New York—I worked on the product design team where I re-designed the meal-logging experience in the app. The UI patterns used here had to be carefully thought out so each use case would be intuitive, as well as elegant and simple. 

Previously, I worked as the premiere UX Designer at [KnowRoaming](http://www.knowroaming.com) in Toronto where I was responsible as the sole designer for re-designing their mobile app from the ground-up. Everything from the core workflow, to the UI, icons and branding was reworked. I worked closely with developers, management and customer suport in order to iterate designs, and achieve the best design possible. 

I was also responsible at Sony, KnowRoaming, Noom, and Zynga, for designing and building prototypes, using various prototyping tools and occasionaly wriiting production web-based code.

I hope I've shown here that I have the relevant experience and skills to be a great designer at Huge. I hope to chat with someone from the team soon.
