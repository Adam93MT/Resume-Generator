Hi Google Team,

I'm a recent grad of Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterlooâ€”a multidisciplinary engineering program with an emphasis on holistic design thinking. I have worked as a designer for companies like Noom in New York, KnowRoaming in Toronto, and Sony, and as a product manager for Zynga. With my combined work experience and education, I  believe I have the necessary skills, drive, and passion to be a successful interaction designer with Google.
