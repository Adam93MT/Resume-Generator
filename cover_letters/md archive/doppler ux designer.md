Hi Doppler Team,

I'm incredibly passionate about music and audio, as I hope is evident by the projects and activities on my resume. I have recently finished my degree in Systems Design Engineering—a multidisciplinary engineering program with a focus on design-thinking—part of which included five 4-month long internships in UX and product management. 

In the final year of school I and my team designed and build Chameleon Hearing Protection, a smart earmuff which adapted to the noise level of the environment, enabling both effective communication and adequate protection. I was the project lead for this project, and played a large role in all aspects of design and development, from researching user requirements, materials research and mechanical design, circuit design, and controller programming. This was a huge learning experience for me in the product development cycle.

In my most recent UX role at Noom—a health and lifestyle startup in New York—I worked on the product design team where I re-designed the meal-logging experience in the app. The UI patterns used in this workflow had to be carefully thought out so each entry case would be intuitive. I created many mockups and prototypes using Invision, Marvel and Framer, and shared final Sketch files with developers using Zeplin.

As I mentioned previously, music is a big passion of mine. I semi-regularly perform at open mics, and this past April was a soloist in the ICCA (International Competition for Collegiate A Cappella) finalist, the Water Boys.

I hope the information I've provided can show that I have the passion and potential to be a successful UX designer with Doppler!
