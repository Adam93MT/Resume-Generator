Hello Deezer Team,

I am a UX and Product Designer from the University of Waterloo, with a big passion for music. I would love to work for a company building a product that gives people easier access to music.

In my most recent UX role at <a href="http://www.noom.com">Noom</a>—a health and lifestyle startup in New York—I worked on the product design team where I re-designed the meal-logging experience in the app. The UI patterns used here had to be carefully thought out so each entry case would be intuitive. I created many mockups and prototypes using Invision, Marvel and Framer, and shared final Sketch files with developers using Zeplin.

Previously, I worked as the premiere UX Designer at <a href="http://www.knowroaming.com">KnowRoaming</a> in Toronto where I worked on re-designing their app from the ground-up. Everything from the core workflow, to the UI, icons and branding was reworked in my 8 months with the company.

I've recently finished my final-year in Systems Design Engineering, which teaches many engineering diciplines, with an overally emphasis on design-thinking and user-centred design. For my final year design project, I designed and built a <a href="http://adamthompson.ca/Portfolio/?p=chameleon">hearing protection device</a> for use by industrial workers to vary attenuation based on the volume of the environment.

As I mentioned before, music is a big passion of mine. I semi-regularly perform at open mics, and this past April was a soloist in the <a href="https://varsityvocals.com/event/icca-central-semifinal-university-at-buffalo-center-for-the-arts-2/">ICCA finalist</a> group, the Water Boys.

With several years of experience in design already, and a love for music, I feel I have the required skills, experience, and passion to be a successful design intern at Deezer. For more, please visit my portfolio online at adamthompson.ca.
