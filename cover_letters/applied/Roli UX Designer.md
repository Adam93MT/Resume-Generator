Hello Roli Team,

I am a UX and Product Designer from the University of Waterloo, with a big passion for music and audio. I've been singing and playing guitar since before high-school, and have been designing apps since 2013.

In my most recent UX design job at [Noom](noom.com)—a health and lifestyle startup in New York—I worked on the product design team where my main project was to re-design the meal-logging experience in the app, which was a challenging navigation problem. The UI patterns used had to be carefully thought out so each entry case would be  ntuitive. (I write more about this design problem in my portfolio).

More recently I worked as a Product Manager for [Zynga Poker](https://www.zynga.com/poker). Though I worked on a more mature game, in my time there I was exposed to many principles of game design, like the design of a good core loop, meta-game, and balance of the two.

Previously, I worked as the premiere UX Designer at [KnowRoaming](knowroaming.com) in Toronto where I worked on re-designing their account management app from the ground-up—everything from the core workflow to UI and icons. 

I've been making music for many years, both on my own and in groups. In university I performed in many open mics, and was a soloist in the [ICCA Semifinalist](https://varsityvocals.com/event/icca-central-semifinal-university-at-buffalo-center-for-the-arts-2/) group, the Water Boys. For my own music, and for production work as a staff filmmaker, I have recorded and mixed using Logic, and ProTools.

I am currently finishing up my final-year engineering design project at the University of Waterloo, where I am designing and building a hearing protection device for use by stagehands and industrial workers to vary attenuation based on the volume of the environment.

With over 3 years of experience in design, I feel I have the required skills,
experience, and passion to be a successful UX designer Roli. For more, please visit my portfolio online at adamthompson.ca.
